# Fundraiser (FDR) Crytocurrency
The Fundraiser is a crytocurrency designed to make it easy to create a decentralized fund raising community. Fundraiser will be used for all transactions within the Fundraiser community. Implemented on the public Ethereum blockchain as an ERC20 token, Fundraiser will serve as the basis of interoperability with other fundraising services.

## FDR Campaigns
FDR would make it easy to create campaigns that have a target and require a number of FDR's to be fullfilled.
For the inital implementation only a single type of Campaign can be created:
- The campaign would be deployed to the network with a target amount, reason and the target receipient to receive the money when the amount is met.
- Contributors to the campaign can then donate FDR's to the campaign
- If a campaign ends without meeting its target, contributors can choose to get their FDR's back or leave the FDR. Whatever FDR is left will be transfered to the campaign target receipient.

## FDR Token Issuance
In order to finance the Fundraiser community, FDR token distribution events will be offered for sale.
More information on the token distribution and its dates will be shared.
